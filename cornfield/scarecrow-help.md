#### You have chosen to walk towards the scarecrow!
As he sees you approachin he says hello. You ask the scarecrow how can it talk. The scarecrow tells you that
this maze is full of mysteries and wonders but you haven't even seen half of it. You tell the scarecrow you are
feeling a bit lost and don't know where to go. He tells you that you need to keep going straight, then turn
right and keep walking to make it out. You say goodbye to him, and [follow his directions](ending.md).
