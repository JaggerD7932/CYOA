#### You have chosen the path to the farmhouse!
This house is giving you an eerie vibe and you can't just brush it off. You keep walking and observe the
farmhouse. As you keep walking, you start to hear a sound. The sound is coming from inside, it sounds like
something or _someone_ is inside. What do you do?  
Do you go inside and [explore](map.md)
or
do you ignore it and [walk away](../lost.md)?
