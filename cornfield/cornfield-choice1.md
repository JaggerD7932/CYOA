#### You have chosen the cornfield path!
The cornfield is so tall that you can barely see anything around you,
but you keep walking, hoping you can find your way out. You hear crows caw in the distance. The path leads you to an opening, where you see two other paths.  
You can see a farmhouse in the distance but it seems like it's abandonded. Through the other path you
can see a scarecrow. Which path will you choose?  
The path that leads to the [farmhouse](farmhouse.md)
or
the path that leads to the [scarecrow](scarecrow.md)?
